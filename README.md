# Transcriptomic-Analysis-Workshop-Tutorial-

In this study, we focus on analyzing the transcriptomic responses of Brassica napus (rapeseed) root tissues under control and stress conditions. The goal is to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological pathways, and molecular mechanisms associated with stress tolerance and adaptation in B. napus roots.

#Objectives
To quantify global gene expression profiles in root tissues of B. napus under control and stress conditions.
To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in stress responses.
To perform functional enrichment analyses (GO and KEGG) to uncover key biological processes and pathways.
To visualize gene expression patterns and explore potential regulatory networks.

#Experimental Design
Plant Material: Brassica napus root tissues.

#Conditions:
Control: Roots grown under optimal conditions.
Stress: Roots exposed to abiotic stress (e.g., salt stress, drought, or cold stress).
Replicates: At least three biological replicates per condition to ensure statistical robustness.

#Data Acquisition
Sample Preparation: Total RNA is extracted from root tissues, followed by quality assessment using Bioanalyzer or Nanodrop.
Library Preparation & Sequencing: RNA-Seq libraries are prepared and sequenced using Illumina platforms, generating paired-end reads (typically 150 bp).
Data Format: Raw sequencing data in FASTQ format.
